# red-velvet-cake
recipe to be added
If you look beyond the striking appearance of a Red Velvet Cake, you will find that it has a very mild chocolate flavor (it contains just 2 tablespoons (15 grams) of unsweetened cocoa powder. Buttermilk gives this cake its wonderfully moist and tender crumb. Buttermilk has a thick creamy texture with a rich tangy and buttery taste. You can make a good substitute for commercial buttermilk by adding 1 tablespoon of white distilled vinegar, cider vinegar, or lemon juice to 1 cup (240 ml) of milk and letting this mixture sit at room temperature about 10 minutes before using.

Once the Red Velvet Cake has been baked and cooled, I like to chill the layers in the refrigerator until firm before filling and frosting the cake. This extra step makes the spreading of the frosting a much easier task, as a freshly baked cake is quite fragile and when you try to spread the frosting there is a tendency for the cake to tear. Refrigerating the cake first eliminates this problem. s
